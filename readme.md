# [Entropy Wordpress Theme](http://timothy-long.com/entropy)

Entropy is a single-column, content-focused theme for WordPress. It's an ideal starting point for those looking to simplify their blog design, have less features, and allow readers to focus on their content.

* [Live Demo](http://timothy-long.com/examples/entropy)

## Customization

* **Profile photo dimensions:** 200x200px
* **Hero background image dimensions:** (preferably) 1000px wide or larger

There are no theme options provided with Entropy and little-to-no documentation/marginalia provided in the theme files. You'll need a basic understanding of HTML/CSS to do the simplest of things to this theme.

I intend on building a search feature, archives page, and support for pages sometime in the future. Until then, you're on your own!
